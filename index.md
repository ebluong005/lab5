Title: Help! Strange Output in Java Program

Hey everyone,

I'm working on a Java program that is supposed to calculate the factorial of a given number. However, I'm getting a really strange output that I can't seem to figure out. The program is giving me a negative result for the factorial, which doesn't make any sense. I am using mac os and in the wavelet directory. My output is -120 in my code, but it should be 120.

Here's a screenshot of my code and output:

TA's Response:

TA: Hi there!

The code you've provided seems to be correct, so the issue might not be with the code itself. However, I have a suspicion about what could be causing this strange output. Could you please try running the program again, but this time print the value of factorial after each iteration of the loop? You can add an additional System.out.println(factorial); statement inside the loop to achieve this.

Let me know what you find!

Scripting and using vim are powerful tools that I can already see as being usefull in the future. It also something that I'll need more practice and I'm sure these tools will end up makaing my life easier. I think scrpiting espically can be usefull from its abilty to automate tasks.
