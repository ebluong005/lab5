Title: Help! Strange Output in Java Program

Hey everyone,

I'm making a highlight program in java file that uses a substring to check if it is containted in a larger string. I use an if/else statement to check if the substring appears. The thing is I'm getting an unexpected output. I was just making sure my code worked but, my program gave me the output that the substing was not found even though it is in the main string. I'm not entirely sure what is even wrong with my code. I am using macos and I am in the wavelet directory. The input for the main string was "Hello World", and the substring input was "hello". My expected output would of been "Substring found!" but it is "Substring not found!". My bash script worked as well, so I do beleive it is something in the java file itself.

TA's Response:

TA: Hi there!

The code you've provided seems to be  nearly correct, there is a slight error in your code. I can see that the goal of this code to replicate highlighting through checking for sub strings in string. To do you will have to account for case sensitivty. If you want to check if the word itself appears make sure to convert every string in to lowercase or upperrcase then use contain.

Let me know what you find!

Scripting and using vim are powerful tools that I can already see as being usefull in the future. It also something that I'll need more practice and I'm sure these tools will end up makaing my life easier. I think scripiting espically can be usefull from its abilty to automate tasks like compiling code or running testers.
